## <kano-nav>

`kano-nav` is the Kano Universe designed nav bar to provide navigation across all kano online products. It also displays user navigation and notifications

It is built using Polymer and was built for and used in https://apps.kano.me as well as in https://world.kano.me

### Development

To work on this component, install [polyserve](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polyserve), use bower to install the dependencies and then run:

```
polyserve
```

This will bring up a web server that serves the files as if this component was in a `bower_components` folder. This allows to keep the relative paths for the imports and be able to work in dev.
